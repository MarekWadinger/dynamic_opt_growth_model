\begin{abstract}
    This paper presents a comprehensive framework aimed at enhancing education in modeling, optimal control, and nonlinear Model Predictive Control (MPC) through a practical greenhouse climate control model. The framework includes a detailed mathematical model of lettuce growth and greenhouse, which are influenced by real-time external weather conditions obtained via an application programming interface (API).\@ Using this data, the MPC-based approach dynamically adjusts greenhouse conditions, optimizing plant growth, energy consumption, and minimizing the social cost of CO\textsubscript{2}. Simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in balancing energy use with crop yield and reducing CO\textsubscript{2} emissions, contributing to economic efficiency and environmental sustainability.
    We aim to provide students with a hands-on platform to understand the complexity of MPC and the trade-offs between profitability and sustainability in agricultural systems. By leveraging real-world data and dynamic simulations, this model allows students to explore and apply control theories in a practical context, fostering deeper learning and problem-solving skills. This makes the framework a valuable tool not only for optimizing lettuce production but also for enriching control systems education. The educational platform for this framework can be accessed at \url{ecompc4greenhouse.streamlit.app}.

\section{Introduction}

% - General introduction (why is it important that we do what we do)
In the rapidly evolving field of engineering, there is an increasing demand for graduates who possess not only theoretical knowledge but also practical skills applicable in real-world scenarios. Technical university education requires a solid foundation in theory coupled with opportunities for practical learning, often gained through participation in projects, solving real-world problems, and conducting experiments. The benefits of using interactive tools in control theory instruction have been highlighted in previous works, such as those by~\cite{Emami1991} and~\cite{Guzman2013}. Importantly, practical learning does not always rely on physical experiments with costly equipment in labs; simulations and interactive tasks can serve as effective alternatives, offering new learning opportunities.

Current farming practices are labor-intensive, seasonal, constrained by irrigation, and rely on subsidized inputs, leading to environmental issues such as eutrophication, deforestation and soil degradation. With nearly 70\% of global water resources consumed by agriculture~\cite{Debroy2024}, greenhouses offer a solution by providing controlled environments that enhance productivity beyond what open-field cultivation can achieve. However, these systems face challenges, such as fluctuating internal temperatures that can harm crops. Effective climate management, through controlled ventilation and heating, is essential for maintaining optimal conditions and improving yields~\cite{Wu2019}.

% - Concrete introduction (what is the state of the art in the domain)
Solar radiation is vital for plant growth and energy generation in greenhouses. Key metrics include Global Horizontal Irradiance (\(GHI\)) and Photosynthetically Active Radiation (\(PAR\)), the latter directly influencing photosynthesis. Recent research has advanced models for accurate \(PAR\) prediction~\cite{Iddio2020, MaLu2022}, while various control methods, such as adaptive control, nonlinear feedback control, fuzzy control, robust control, and optimal control, have been explored to enhance greenhouse environments and resource use efficiency.

\end{figure}

% RP: Nerozumiem poradiu jednotlivych pristupov. Nevychadza z obrazka ani nijak logicky nenadvazuje.
Adaptive control adjusts parameters based on real-time feedback~\cite{Tian2022}, while nonlinear feedback control addresses system complexity with advanced algorithms~\cite{Bood2023}. Fuzzy control manages imprecise data and uncertainties~\cite{smartcities7030055} and robust control ensures stability despite disturbances~\cite{Zhang2021}. Optimal control fine-tunes actions for better outcomes~\cite{Debroy2024, SVENSEN2024108578}. Despite their strengths, these approaches often require complex implementation, with frequent adjustments leading to higher energy consumption and wear on actuators.

% RP: Nerozumiem co chce povedat veta o PID uvadzajuca odstavec.
Consequently, PID controllers remain popular for their simplicity and effectiveness. However, IoT and machine learning are also being integrated into greenhouse control, as demonstrated by Wang et al.~\cite{Wang2024}, who combined these technologies with PID for real-time monitoring. Nonetheless, managing greenhouse systems using PID can be challenging due to the need for multiple controllers and extensive tuning. This process is time-consuming and case-dependent, often lacking guaranteed optimal results.
% RP: Druhykrat "consequently" v jednom odstavci.
Consequently, MPC has emerged as a preferred approach for greenhouse climate control~\cite{Hu2022}, enabling continuous adjustment of setpoints through sample-by-sample online optimization. This approach, however, increases computational demands.

% - Educational context and relevance
Integrating advanced control techniques into education has become increasingly important. Recent studies~\cite{WangEducation2024, Zakova2024} have shown that web-based simulation platforms significantly enhance students' problem-solving skills by bridging the gap between theory and practice. Inspired by this approach, our framework aims to provide a similar educational experience within greenhouse climate control, focusing on modeling, optimal control, and Nonlinear Economic Model Predictive Control (NEMPC).

% - Presentation of our contribution
This study presents a web interface for optimizing greenhouse climate control, to achieve enhanced crop yields, energy efficiency and reduction in CO\textsubscript{2} emissions. Utilizing principles of thermodynamics, fluid dynamics, and mass transfer, along with real weather and carbon intensity forecasts we developed a simulation environment employed by NEMPC to adjust ventilation, heating, humidification, and CO\textsubscript{2} enrichment in real-time. Beyond technical contributions, the framework serves as an educational tool, allowing students to engage with real-world data and explore the economic and sustainability trade-offs in agricultural systems. Thus, this versatile platform enhances control education by combining theoretical concepts with practical skills in automatic control.

\section{Methodology}\label{sec:methodology}

\section{Greenhouse Climate Model}\label{sec:greenhouse}
% RP: Tak co "Methodology" alebo "Greenhouse Climate Model"?
In this section we provide a mathematical model of the greenhouse environment, focusing on wind, temperature, humidity, and CO\textsubscript{2} concentration dynamics that
% RP: Nie radsej "implements" ako "simplifies"?
simplifies the GES software~\cite{rmward61_2019} based on the Gembloux Dynamic Greenhouse Climate Model~\cite{GDGCM} and work by Vanthoor~\cite{Vanthoor2011}.

    \caption{A simplified diagram of the heat, mass and CO\textsubscript{2} exchanges modelled within the framework. Image adapted from~\cite{rmward61_2019}.}\label{fig:diagram}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Temperature Dynamics}\label{subsec:temperature}

The temperature dynamics inside the greenhouse are modeled by considering the energy exchange due to convection, radiation, and conduction --- Fig.~\ref{fig:diagram}. The temperatures of different components (e.g., cover, internal air, vegetation, tray, etc.) are described using the following equations.

The convective heat transfer between two surfaces is given by
\begin{equation}
    \text{Nu} = \max \left( \text{Nu}_G, \text{Nu}_R \right),
\end{equation}
where \(\text{Nu}_G\) and \(\text{Nu}_R\) are the Nusselt numbers for free and forced convection, respectively
\begin{align}
    \text{Nu}_G & = 0.5  {\left( \frac{\text{Gr}}{10^5} \right)}^{0.25} + 0.13  {\left(\frac{\text{Gr}}{10^5}\right)}^{0.33} \\
    \text{Nu}_R & = 0.6  {\left(\frac{\text{Re}}{20000}\right)}^{0.5} + 0.032  {\left(\frac{\text{Re}}{20000}\right)}^{0.8},
\end{align}
where Re represents the Reynolds number, and Gr represents the Grashof number.

The heat flux due to convection is then calculated as
\begin{equation}
    Q_{\text{conv}} = A\, \text{Nu}\, \lambda \frac{T_1 - T_2}{d},
\end{equation}
% RP: \lambda nie je definovana
where \(A\) represents the area of a compartment, and \(d\) represents the characteristic length of a compartment.

The radiative heat transfer between two surfaces is described by
\begin{equation}
    Q_{\text{rad}} = \frac{\varepsilon_1  \varepsilon_2}{1 - \rho_1  \rho_2  F_{12}  F_{21}}  \sigma  A_1  F_{12}  \left( T_1^4 - T_2^4 \right),
\end{equation}
where \(\sigma \) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, \(F_{12}\) is the view factor from surface 1 to surface 2, \(T_1\) and \(T_2\) representing the temperatures of the surfaces, and \(\varepsilon \) and \(\rho \) are the emissivity and reflectivity of the surfaces, respectively.

The conductive heat transfer through a medium is given by
\begin{equation}
    Q_{\text{cond}} = \frac{A \lambda}{d} (T_1 - T_2),
\end{equation}
where \(\lambda \) is the thermal conductivity of a compartment, and
% RP: d uz bolo definovane. lepsie by bolo pouzit ine oznacenie
\(d\) is the thickness of the conducting layer.

\subsection{Humidity Dynamics}\label{subsec:humidity}

The humidity within the greenhouse is modeled by considering the mass transfer of water vapor. The specific humidity is calculated as:
% RP: Doteraz neboli dvojbodky pred rovnicami. Treba to zjednotit. Bud su alebo nie.
\begin{equation}
    \text{SH} = \exp\left(11.56 - \frac{4030}{T + 235}\right).
\end{equation}
The moisture content in the air is given by:
\begin{equation}
    C_w = \text{SH} \times \rho_{\text{air}},
\end{equation}
where \(\rho_{\text{air}}\) is the density of air.

The mass transfer of water vapor due to convection is:
\begin{equation}
    Q_{v} = \frac{A  H_{\text{fg}}}{\rho  c}  \frac{\text{Sh}}{\text{Le}}  \frac{\lambda}{d}  \left( C - C_{\text{sat,}T} \right),
\end{equation}
where \(H_{\text{fg}}\) is the latent heat of vaporization, \(\text{Sh}\) is the Sherwood number, and \(\text{Le}\) is the Lewis number,
% RP: \lambda uz bola definovana
\(\lambda \) is the thermal conductivity,
% RP: d uz bolo definovane
\(d\) is the characteristic length, \(A\) is the heat exchange surface area, \(\rho \) is the density of the vapor, \(c\) is the specific heat capacity,
% RP: Co znamena koncentracia pary?
\(C\) is the actual vapor concentration, and \(C_{\text{sat,}T}\) is the saturated vapor concentration at temperature \(T\).

\subsection{Carbon Dioxide Concentration Dynamics}

The CO\textsubscript{2} concentration within the greenhouse is affected by photosynthesis and external conditions. The external CO\textsubscript{2} concentration is computed as:
\begin{equation}
    C_{\text{ext}} = \frac{4 \times 10^{-4}  M_c  P_{\text{atm}}}{R  T_{\text{ext}}},
\end{equation}
where \(M_c\) is the molar mass of CO\textsubscript{2}, \(P_{\text{atm}}\) is the atmospheric pressure, \(R\) is the gas constant, and \(T_{\text{ext}}\) is the external air temperature in Kelvin.

The internal CO\textsubscript{2} concentration in parts per million (ppm) is given by:
\begin{equation}
    C_{\text{int, ppm}} = \frac{C_c  R  T_i}{M_c  P_{\text{atm}}} \times 10^6,
\end{equation}
where \(C_c\) is the CO\textsubscript{2} density, and \(T_{\text{in}}\) is the internal air temperature in Kelvin.

The greenhouse climate model integrates the physical models of temperature, humidity, and CO\textsubscript{2} concentration into a dynamic system represented by a state vector \(\mathbf{z}\)
% RP: takto "(11 \(\times \) 1)" sa velkost vektora nezapisuje.
(11 \(\times \) 1) = [\(T_c, T_i, T_v, T_m, T_p, T_f, T_s, C_w, C_c, x_{\text{sdw}}, x_{\text{nsdw}}\)], and input vector \(\mathbf{u}\) (2 \(\times \) 1) = 
% RP: Co znamena "Ventilation" a "Heating"? Chcelo by to fyzikalne veliciny.
[\text{Ventilation}, \text{Heating}]. The \(T_c\) represents the cover temperature, \(T_i\) the internal air temperature, \(T_v\) the planted salad temperature, \(T_m\) the growing medium temperature, \(T_p\) the tray temperature, \(T_f\) the floor temperature, and \(T_s\) the temperature of the soil layer. Additionally, \(C_w\) denotes the density of water vapor, \(C_c\) the CO\textsubscript{2} density, \(x_{\text{sdw}}\) the structural dry weight of the plant, and \(x_{\text{nsdw}}\) the non-structural dry weight of the plant.
% RP: Cloveka by zaujimalo ako sa dostane k rovniciam dynamiky. Nie je tu uvedene nic k rychlosti rastu salatu.

\subsection{Actuation Control Systems}
% RP: Na control konferencii mi pride definicia akcneho clena zbytocna.
An actuator is a critical component within a system responsible for generating force, torque, or displacement in a controlled manner~\cite{Escudier2019}. In our implementation, actuators operate by converting an input control signal from the system into the appropriate mechanical energy required to regulate environmental variables~\cite{Butterfield2018}. These actuators serve to maintain optimal conditions for crop growth by
% RP: "adjust" sa da pouzit skor na akcne cleny ako na riadene premenne
adjusting temperature, humidity, ventilation, and CO\textsubscript{2} concentration. Each actuator's functionality is modeled to simulate its contribution to the overall energy balance, operating costs, and CO\textsubscript{2} emissions of the greenhouse. Below, we describe the main equations used to model these actuators, summarized in Table~\ref{tab:actuators}.
% RP: Preco sa zrazu bavime o 4 akcnych clenoch ked v predchadzajucej casti boli dva vstupy?

\begin{table}
    \centering
    \caption{Summary of Actuator Model Parameters}\label{tab:actuators}
    \begin{tabular}{lcc}
        \toprule
        Actuator                      & Label                   & Unit                   \\
        \midrule
        Heater                        & \( Q_{\text{heater}} \) & W                      \\
        Fan                           & \( R_{\text{fan}} \)    & m\textsuperscript{3}/s \\
        Humidifier                    & \( V_{\text{humid}} \)  & l/h                    \\
        CO\textsubscript{2} Generator & \( G_{\text{CO2}} \)    & kg/h                   \\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}


We model the actuators by adjusting the control signal, \( u(t) \), which ranges from 0 to 100\%, where 0\% represents no activation, and 100\% corresponds to the maximum actuation level. The actuation level, \( a(u) \), is then calculated as:
\begin{equation}
% RP: Zrazu tu zmizli bodky/ciarky za rovnicami. Treba to zjednotit.
    a(u) = \frac{u}{100}  a_{\text{max}}
\end{equation}
where \( a_{\text{max}} \) represents the scale of the specific actuator, such as the maximum heating power or airflow.

The \textbf{power consumption} of each actuator, \( P(u) \), is determined by:
\begin{equation}
    P(u) = \frac{p_{\text{unit}}}{\eta}  a(u)
\end{equation}
where \( p_{\text{unit}} \) is the power per unit of actuation, and \( \eta \) represents the efficiency of the actuator.

The \textbf{total energy cost}, \( C_{\text{energy}}(u) \), in EUR is calculated as:
\begin{equation}
    C_{\text{energy}}(u) = \frac{E_{\text{cost}}  \Delta t}{1,000 \, 3,600}  P(u)
\end{equation}
where \( E_{\text{cost}} \) is the cost of energy in EUR per kWh, and \( \Delta t \) is the time step in seconds.

The \textbf{CO\textsubscript{2} emissions}, \( E_{\text{CO2}}(u) \), generated by each actuator are given by:
\begin{equation}
    E_{\text{CO2}}(u) = \frac{I_{\text{CO2}}  \Delta t}{1,000  \, 36,000}  P(u)
    % RP: Preco 36000? Nema tam byt 3600?
\end{equation}
where \( I_{\text{CO2}} \) is the carbon intensity in gCO\textsubscript{2}eq/kWh~\cite{ElectricityMaps2022}. The associated cost of these emissions is:
\begin{equation}
    C_{\text{CO2}}(u) = C_{\text{CO2cost}}  E_{\text{CO2}}(u)
\end{equation}
where \( C_{\text{CO2cost}} \) is the social cost of CO\textsubscript{2} in EUR/gCO\textsubscript{2}eq.\\

The \textbf{heater actuator}'s heating power, \( Q_{\text{heater}} \), is determined based on the desired setpoint temperature, \( T_{\text{sp}} \), and air volume of the greenhouse, \( V \):
\begin{equation}
    Q_{\text{heater}} = \rho_{\text{air}}  c_{\text{air}}  V  (T_{\text{sp}} - T_{\text{ambient}})  \frac{Q_{\text{air}}}{3600}
    % RP: V_humid bol pritok vody a teda V uz nemoze byt pouzite ako objem.
\end{equation}
where \( \rho_{\text{air}} \) is the density of air, \( c_{\text{air}} \) is the specific heat capacity of air, and \( Q_{\text{air}} \) represents the fresh air exchange rate per hour.

The \textbf{fan actuator} controls the air exchange rate. The ventilation rate, \( R_{\text{fan}} \), is based on the
% RP: Co znamena "air changes per hour"?
air changes per hour (\( Q_{\text{air}} \)) and greenhouse volume:
\begin{equation}
    R_{\text{fan}} = V  \frac{\text{\( Q_{\text{air}} \)}}{3600}
\end{equation}

The \textbf{humidifier actuator} controls the humidity level within the greenhouse. The humidification rate, \( V_{\text{humid}} \), is calculated based on the air volume and the difference in absolute humidity at 40\% and 80\% relative humidity:
\begin{equation}
    % RP: Nesedia jednotky.
    V_{\text{humid}} = V  \frac{(\phi_{a, 80} - \phi_{a, 40})}{\rho_{\text{water}}}
\end{equation}
where \( \phi_{a, 80} \) and \( \phi_{a, 40} \) are the absolute humidity levels at 80\% and 40\% relative humidity, and \( \rho_{\text{water}} \) is the density of water.

The \textbf{CO\textsubscript{2} actuator} increases the CO\textsubscript{2} concentration within the greenhouse. The CO\textsubscript{2} generation rate, \( G_{\text{CO2}} \), is based on the desired change of the CO\textsubscript{2} density per hour, \( \dot{c}_{co2} \) and air volume:
\begin{equation}
    G_{\text{CO2}} = \dot{c}_{co2}  V
\end{equation}
% RP: G_{\text{CO2}} uz bolo definovane
where \( G_{\text{CO2}} \) is the CO\textsubscript{2} generation in kg/h.


\section{Nonlinear economic model predictive control}\label{sec:mpc}

A nonlinear economic model predictive control~(NEMPC) is adopted to maximize the profit from growing lettuce in a greenhouse. The objective of the proposed MPC for greenhouse control is to optimize the economic performance of the greenhouse system by controlling its actuators, such as heating, ventilation, and CO\textsubscript{2} injection. This is achieved by maximizing lettuce yield while minimizing operating costs over a finite prediction horizon. The NEMPC framework incorporates the dynamics of the greenhouse and time-varying external conditions such as weather.

\subsection{System Dynamics}\label{subsec:mpc_dynamics}

The greenhouse system is modeled by a set of nonlinear state equations (see Section~\ref{sec:greenhouse}) that describe the evolution of the greenhouse states, such as temperature, humidity, and biomass. The discrete-time nonlinear system is given by:
\begin{equation}
    x(t+1) = f\left( x(t), u(t), p(t) \right),
\end{equation}
where \(x(t) \in \mathbb{R}^{n_x}\) represents the state vector at time step \(t\), \(u(t) \in \mathbb{R}^{n_u}\) represents the control input vector (actuators), and \(p(t)\) are time-varying parameters that include external climate conditions such as temperature, radiation, and humidity.

\subsection{Economic Objective Function}\label{subsec:mpc_objective}

The goal of the economic MPC is to maximize the revenue from lettuce production while minimizing the costs associated with actuator use. The objective function is composed of two terms: the profit from biomass accumulation and the costs of actuators.

The revenue from lettuce production is proportional to the change in biomass between the initial state and the current state, expressed as:
\begin{equation}
    R(t) = P_L  \frac{(x_{\mathrm{sdw}}(t) + x_{\mathrm{nsdw}}(t)) - (x_{0, \mathrm{sdw}} + x_{0, \mathrm{nsdw} })}{\rho_{dw}}  A_c,
\end{equation}
where \(P_L\) is the price of lettuce per gram, \(A_c\) is the cultivated area, \(x_{\mathrm{sdw}}\) and \(x_{\mathrm{nsdw}}\) are the biomass-related states, and \(rho_{dw}\) stands for dry-to-wet ratio.

In addition, the cost of operating the actuators at each time step is given by:
\begin{equation}
    C_u(t) = \sum_{i} \left( C_{\text{energy}}(u_i(t)) + C_{\text{CO2}}(u_i(t)) \right),
\end{equation}
where \(C_{\text{energy}}(u_i(t))\) is the cost associated with the actuator signal \(u_i(t)\) and \(C_{\text{CO2}}(u_i(t))\) represents the cost related to CO\textsubscript{2} emissions from the actuator.

Thus, the total cost at each time step is:
\begin{equation}
    l_t = -R(t) + C_u(t).
\end{equation}

\subsection{Optimization Problem Formulation}

The objective of the nonlinear economic MPC is to minimize the sum of the stage costs \(l_t\) over a finite prediction horizon \(N\), subject to system dynamics and constraints. The optimization problem is formulated as follows:
\begin{equation}
    \min_{{\{u(t)\}}_{t=0}^{N-1}} \sum_{t=0}^{N-1} l_t(x(t), u(t)),
\end{equation}
subject to:
\begin{align}
    x(t+1)   & = f(x(t), u(t), p(t)),                           \\
    u_{\min} & \leq u(t) \leq u_{\max}, \quad \forall t = 0, \dots, N-1, \\
    x_{\min} & \leq x(t) \leq x_{\max}, \quad \forall t = 0, \dots, N,   \\
    x(0)     & = x_{\text{initial}}.
\end{align}
Here, \(x_{\min}\) and \(x_{\max}\) represent the bounds on the state variables, and \(u_{\min}\) and \(u_{\max}\) define the bounds on the control inputs, i.e., actuator signals.

\subsection{Time-Varying Parameters}

The external climate conditions are modeled as time-varying parameters~(TVP), which influence the system dynamics. These parameters include variables such as outdoor temperature, solar radiation, and humidity, and are provided by real-time weather data. The parameters are incorporated into the state equations, influencing the evolution of the greenhouse states.

\section{Educational Web Interface}
Figure~\ref{fig:web} demonstrates the interactive web-based educational tool. Via four layers of user customization of the greenhouse,
% RP: "participants" coho?
participants grasped the main benefits of optimal control and challenges related to non-linearity. The first layer is the greenhouse structure, where the user can select the shape of the greenhouse, affecting the energy exchange with the environment and suggested scaling of the actuation units.

The second layer is the orientation and location of the greenhouse, which affects the solar radiation and the weather conditions. Here, we establish a connection to weather and carbon intensity forecast APIs to provide real-time data along with forecasts and history replays.

The third layer is the actuation units, where the user can overwrite the suggested scaling and select the actuators for the heating, ventilation, humidification, and CO\textsubscript{2} enrichment. Meanwhile, the fourth layer is the control strategy, where the user can influence the control parameters, including the objective function and constraints of the economic MPC controller.

While the user is customizing the greenhouse, the web interface provides real-time feedback. The user can also simulate the greenhouse operation over a selected period of time and analyze the results in terms of energy consumption, crop yield, and economic output.

\section{Results}
% Comparison of controlled greenhouse vs greenhouse without actuation
In the first set of simulations, we analyzed the nonlinear behavior of the greenhouse under varying climate conditions and steps in actuation. We observed how different actuations influence the growth of the structural and non-structural dry weight of the plant. The simulations were run under a mild climate of Bratislava (Slovakia), from 11\textsuperscript{th} October for a 24-hour window. Figure~\ref{fig:steps} shows that under given climate conditions, 
the influence of ventilation and humidification is insignificant on growth.
% RP: Kde toto clovek vidi? Treba ho nasmerovat.
Nevertheless, it has a positive effect on convection and the overall transfer of energy. Meanwhile, intense heating positively affects the conversion of non-structural dry weight into structural one but does not influence the overall non-structural dry weight buildup. CO\textsubscript{2} enrichment has a significant impact on non-structural plant growth.

The second set of simulations compares the performance of the proposed NEMPC algorithm with a no-control scenario. The parameters of NEMPC are as follows in Table~\ref{tab:parameters}. Results in Table~\ref{tab:comparison} demonstrate that the proposed economic MPC algorithm increased crop yield by 9\% and increased profit by more than 4\% in just 15 days of growth. The cost function of the NEMPC algorithm also included the social cost of the carbon intensity of used energy sources, which reduced CO\textsubscript{2} consumption by 98\% while decreasing the growth 4 times, compared to a scenario where the social cost of CO\textsubscript{2} was not minimized. This means that there is a significant trade-off between the economic output and the carbon intensity of the energy sources. While the primary objective of the farmers might be to maximize the economic output, consideration of the environmental impact of the production should be assessed.

% Educational trials
% RP: Malo by tu byt povedane, o aku velku vzorku studentov sa jedna.
To assess the educational impact of our proposed paper, we conducted a survey among students who interacted with the web-based application. The survey measured the participants' prior knowledge and their learning outcomes in four key areas: mathematical modeling, optimal process control, economic process control, and MPC.

The results show a varied range of initial expertise levels in both modeling and process control, with participants rating their skills from novice (1) to advanced (5). Despite this variation, the application demonstrated a significant educational benefit across all experience levels.

such as Karolína and Miska, reported moderate improvements in understanding mathematical modeling, optimal control, and economic control, with a strong positive impact noted for MPC.\@ These results suggest that the framework is accessible to beginners and helps building foundational knowledge.

\paragraph{High-Skilled Users}
More experienced participants, such as Sofiia and Martin, rated the application as highly beneficial in all four categories. They noted substantial improvements in their understanding of complex control techniques, particularly in mathematical modeling and MPC, validating the educational potential of the framework for users with advanced backgrounds.

\paragraph{General Feedback}
The participants' qualitative feedback further highlights the application's potential. Participants emphasized that with additional information, the tool could be used by a broader audience, including industrial farmers, to design and optimize greenhouse placement in practical settings. This points to the dual benefit of the application: it not only enhances student learning but could also have real-world applicability in sustainable greenhouse design.

These findings suggest that the proposed framework effectively supports educational objectives, promoting understanding across a spectrum of learners. It also has the potential to be adapted for broader use beyond educational contexts, providing valuable insights into the design of sustainable greenhouse systems.
