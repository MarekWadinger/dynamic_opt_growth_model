\begin{abstract}
    This paper introduces a mathematical model of lettuce growth, integrating key variables such as temperature, light, and humidity, which are influenced by external weather conditions. To account for these external factors, we employ an API to obtain real-time weather forecasts, enabling the dynamic adjustment of greenhouse conditions using a heating system when necessary. The MPC-based approach forecasts future plant growth and energy requirements, enabling precise control over environmental factors. Simulations demonstrate that our approach effectively balances energy consumption with crop yield, resulting in enhanced profitability. The model not only optimizes economic output (€) but also provides a valuable tool for planning and improving greenhouse operations.

\section{Introduction}
% - General introduction (why is it important that we do what we do)
Most current farming practices are labor-intensive, seasonal, constrained by irrigation, and dependent on subsidized inputs, leading to significant issues like eutrophication, deforestation, and soil degradation. It also consumes nearly 70\,\% of global water resources~\cite{Debroy2024}. Greenhouses are pivotal in enhancing agricultural productivity by providing controlled environments that surpass the productivity of open-air cultivation. Despite their benefits, greenhouses face significant challenges due to fluctuating internal temperatures that can lead to crop fading and death. To counteract these issues, it is crucial to improve greenhouse environments through effective climate management, incorporating ventilation or heating to regulate internal conditions and enhance crop yields~\cite{Wu2019}.

% - Concrete introduction (what is the state of the art in the domain)
Solar radiation is fundamental to both plant growth and energy generation in a greenhouse. Key metrics include Global Horizontal Irradiance ($GHI$) and Photosynthetically Active Radiation ($PAR$), with $PAR$ being directly responsible for photosynthesis. Recent research has focused on accurately estimating diffuse $PAR$ and its impact on plant growth, leading to the development of sophisticated models that predict $PAR$ with varying degrees of accuracy~\cite{Iddio2020, MaLu2022}. In parallel, methods such as adaptive control, nonlinear feedback control, fuzzy control, robust control, and optimum control have been explored for optimizing greenhouse environments, aiming to boost efficiency, resource use, and crop yield. In general, we identify two main types of greenhouse control algorithms: conventional control and optimal control. Conventional control aims to reduce the difference between setpoints and actual measurements. On the other hand, optimal control incorporates factors such as greenhouse dynamics, actuator capabilities, energy consumption, and crop responses into the control strategy

    \caption{A simplified diagram representing greenhouse control algorithms. Image adapted from~\cite{Trepanier2024}.}
    \label{fig:flowchart}
\end{figure}

Adaptive control adjusts parameters based on real-time feedback~\cite{Tian2022}, while nonlinear feedback control tackles system complexities with advanced algorithms~\cite{Bood2023}. Fuzzy control addresses imprecise data and uncertainties~\cite{smartcities7030055}, and robust control maintains stability despite disturbances~\cite{Zhang2021}. Optimum control aims to fine-tune actions for best outcomes~\cite{Debroy2024, SVENSEN2024108578}. However, these techniques often demand substantial computational power and intricate implementation, additionally, frequent adjustments raise energy consumption and actuator wear.

Consequently, PID controllers remained popular due to their simplicity and effectiveness. IoT and machine learning advancements are also enhancing greenhouse control, with Wang et al.~\cite{Wang2024} combining these technologies with PID for real-time monitoring. Despite improvements, challenges accompany PID control due to the complexity of greenhouse systems requiring multiple controllers and extensive tuning. The process remains time-consuming and dependent on optimization, often without guaranteed optimal results. Therefore, MPC has gained traction in greenhouse climate control~\cite{Hu2022}, however, opting for continuously adjusting parameter setpoints through online optimization on a sample-by-sample basis. This iterative optimization procedure can escalate computational load, thereby complicating system operation.

\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:methodology}

\section{Greenhouse Climate Model}
\label{sec:greenhouse}

In this section we provides a mathematical model of the greenhouse environment, focusing on temperature, humidity, and CO$_2$ concentration dynamics, that simplifies the GES software~\cite{rmward61_2019}, based on the Gembloux Dynamic Greenhouse Climate Model (GDGCM)~\cite{GDGCM} and on the thesis by Vanthoor~\cite{Vanthoor2011}.

\subsection{Temperature Dynamics}
\label{subsec:temperature}

The temperature dynamics inside the greenhouse are modeled by considering the energy exchange due to convection, radiation, and conduction --- Fig.~\ref{fig:diagram}. The temperatures of different components (e.g., cover, internal air, vegetation, tray, etc.) are described using the following equations.

The convective heat transfer between two surfaces is given by
\begin{equation}
    \text{Nu} = \max \left( \text{Nu}_G, \text{Nu}_R \right),
\end{equation}
where $\text{Nu}_G$ and $\text{Nu}_R$ are the Nusselt numbers for free and forced convection, respectively
\begin{align}
    \text{Nu}_G & = 0.5 \cdot \left(\frac{\text{Gr}}{10^5}\right)^{0.25} + 0.13 \cdot \left(\frac{\text{Gr}}{10^5}\right)^{0.33}   \\
    \text{Nu}_R & = 0.6 \cdot \left(\frac{\text{Re}}{20000}\right)^{0.5} + 0.032 \cdot \left(\frac{\text{Re}}{20000}\right)^{0.8},
\end{align}
where $Re$ represents the Reynolds number, and $Gr$ represents the Grashof number.

The heat flux due to convection is then calculated as
\begin{equation}
    Q_{\text{conv}} = A \cdot \text{Nu} \cdot \lambda \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{d},
\end{equation}
where $A$ represents the area of a compartment, and $d$ represents the characteristic length of a compartment.

The radiative heat transfer between two surfaces is described by
\begin{equation}
    Q_{\text{rad}} = \frac{\varepsilon_1 \cdot \varepsilon_2}{1 - \rho_1 \cdot \rho_2 \cdot F_{12} \cdot F_{21}} \cdot \sigma \cdot A_1 \cdot F_{12} \cdot \left( T_1^4 - T_2^4 \right),
\end{equation}
where $\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, $F_{12}$ is the view factor from surface 1 to surface 2, $T_1$ and $T_2$ representing the temperatures of the surfaces, and $\varepsilon$ and $\rho$ are the emissivity and reflectivity of the surfaces, respectively.

The conductive heat transfer through a medium is given by
\begin{equation}
    Q_{\text{cond}} = \frac{A \cdot \lambda}{d} \cdot (T_1 - T_2),
\end{equation}
where $\lambda$ is the thermal conductivity of a compartment, and $d$ is the thickness of the conducting layer.

\subsection{Humidity Dynamics}
\label{subsec:humidity}

The humidity within the greenhouse is modeled by considering the mass transfer of water vapor. The specific humidity is calculated as:
\begin{equation}
    \text{SH} = \exp\left(11.56 - \frac{4030}{T + 235}\right).
\end{equation}
The moisture content in the air is given by:
\begin{equation}
    C_w = \text{SH} \times \rho_{\text{air}},
\end{equation}
where $\rho_{\text{air}}$ is the density of air.

The mass transfer of water vapor due to convection is:
\begin{equation}
    Q_{v} = \frac{A \cdot H_{\text{fg}}}{\rho \cdot c} \cdot \frac{\text{Sh}}{\text{Le}} \cdot \frac{\lambda}{d} \cdot \left( C - C_{\text{sat,}T} \right),
\end{equation}
where $H_{\text{fg}}$ is the latent heat of vaporization, $\text{Sh}$ is the Sherwood number, and $\text{Le}$ is the Lewis number, $\lambda$ is the thermal conductivity, $d$ is the characteristic length, $A$ is the heat exchange surface area, $\rho$ is the density of the vapor, $c$ is the specific heat capacity, $C$ is the actual vapor concentration, and $C_{\text{sat,}T}$ is the vapor concentration at temperature $T$.

\subsection{CO$_2$ Concentration Dynamics}
\label{subsec:concentration}

The CO$_2$ concentration within the greenhouse is affected by photosynthesis and external conditions. The external CO$_2$ concentration is computed as:
\begin{equation}
    C_{\text{ext}} = \frac{4 \times 10^{-4} \cdot M_c \cdot P_{\text{atm}}}{R \cdot T_{\text{ext}}},
\end{equation}
where $M_c$ is the molar mass of CO$_2$, $P_{\text{atm}}$ is the atmospheric pressure, $R$ is the gas constant, and $T_{\text{ext}}$ is the external air temperature in Kelvin.

The internal CO$_2$ concentration in parts per million (ppm) is given by:
\begin{equation}
    C_{\text{int, ppm}} = \frac{C_c \cdot R \cdot T_i}{M_c \cdot P_{\text{atm}}} \times 10^6,
\end{equation}
where $C_c$ is the CO$_2$ density, and $T_{\text{in}}$ is the internal air temperature in Kelvin.

The greenhouse climate model integrates the physical mo-dels of temperature, humidity, and CO$_2$ concentration into a dynamic system represented by a state vector $\mathbf{z}$ (11 $\times$ 1) = [$T_c, T_i, T_v, T_m, T_p, T_f, T_s, C_w, C_c, x_{\text{sdw}}, x_{\text{nsdw}}$], and input vector $\mathbf{u}$ (2 $\times$ 1) = [\text{Ventilation}, \text{Heating}]. The $T_c$ represents the cover temperature, $T_i$ the internal air temperature, $T_v$ the planted salad temperature, $T_m$ the growing medium temperature, $T_p$ the tray temperature, $T_f$ the floor temperature, and $T_s$ the temperature of the soil layer. Additionally, $C_w$ denotes the density of water vapor, $C_c$ the CO$_2$ density, $x_{\text{sdw}}$ the structural dry weight of the plant, and $x_{\text{nsdw}}$ the non-structural dry weight of the plant.

\section{Nonlinear economic model predictive control}
\label{sec:mpc}
A nonlinear economic model predictive control~(NEMPC) is adopted to maximize the profit from growing lettuce in a greenhouse. The objective of the proposed economic MPC for greenhouse control is to optimize the economic performance of the greenhouse system by controlling its actuators, such as heating, ventilation, and CO$_2$ injection. This is achieved by maximizing lettuce yield while minimizing operating costs over a finite prediction horizon. The nonlinear model predictive control framework incorporates the dynamics of the greenhouse and time-varying external conditions such as climate.

\subsection{System Dynamics}
\label{subsec:mpc_dynamics}

The greenhouse system is modeled by a set of nonlinear state equations (see section~\ref{sec:greenhouse}) that describe the evolution of the greenhouse states, such as temperature, humidity, and biomass. The discrete-time nonlinear system is given by:
\begin{equation}
	x(t+1) = f\left( x(t), u(t), \text{TVP}(t) \right),
\end{equation}
where $x(t) \in \mathbb{R}^{n_x}$ represents the state vector at time step $t$, $u(t) \in \mathbb{R}^{n_u}$ represents the control input vector (actuators), and $\text{TVP}(t)$ are time-varying parameters that include external climate conditions such as temperature, radiation, and humidity.

\subsection{Economic Objective Function}
\label{subsec:mpc_objective}

The goal of the economic MPC is to maximize the revenue from lettuce production while minimizing the costs associated with actuator use. The objective function is composed of two terms: the profit from biomass, i.e. the dry-weight of the lettuce, accumulation and the costs of actuators.

The revenue from lettuce production is proportional to the change in biomass between the initial state and the current state, expressed as:
\begin{equation}
	R(t) = P_L \cdot \frac{(x_{\mathrm{sdw}}(t) + x_{\mathrm{nsdw}}(t)) - (x_{0, \mathrm{sdw}} + x_{0, \mathrm{nsdw} })}{\rho_{dw}} \cdot A_c,
\end{equation}
where $P_L$ is the price of lettuce per gram, $A_c$ is the cultivated area, and $x_{\mathrm{sdw}}$ and $x_{\mathrm{nsdw}}$ are the biomass-related states.

In addition, the cost of operating the actuators at each time step is given by:
\begin{equation}
	C_u(t) = \sum_{i} \left( C_{\text{signal}}(u_i(t)) + C_{\text{CO2}}(u_i(t)) \right),
\end{equation}
where $C_{\text{signal}}(u_i(t))$ is the cost associated with the actuator signal $u_i(t)$ and $C_{\text{CO2}}(u_i(t))$ represents the cost related to CO$_2$ emissions from the actuator.

Thus, the total cost at each time step is:
\begin{equation}
	l_t = -R(t) + C_u(t).
\end{equation}

\subsection{Optimization Problem Formulation}

The objective of the nonlinear economic MPC is to minimize the sum of the stage costs $l_t$ over a finite prediction horizon $N$, subject to system dynamics and constraints. The optimization problem is formulated as:
\begin{equation}
	\min_{\{u(t)\}_{t=0}^{N-1}} \sum_{t=0}^{N-1} l_t(x(t), u(t)),
\end{equation}
subject to:
\begin{align}
	x(t+1) &= f(x(t), u(t), \text{TVP}(t)), \\
	u_{\min} &\leq u(t) \leq u_{\max}, \quad \forall t = 0, \dots, N-1, \\
	x_{\min} &\leq x(t) \leq x_{\max}, \quad \forall t = 0, \dots, N, \\
	x(0) &= x_{\text{initial}}.
\end{align}
Here, $x_{\min}$ and $x_{\max}$ represent the bounds on the state variables, and $u_{\min}$ and $u_{\max}$ define the bounds on the control inputs, i.e., actuator signals.

\subsection{Time-Varying Parameters (TVP)}

The external climate conditions are modeled as time-varying parameters (TVP), which influence the system dynamics. These parameters include variables such as outdoor temperature, solar radiation, and humidity, and are provided by real-time climate data. These parameters are incorporated into the state equations, influencing the evolution of the greenhouse states.
